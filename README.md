Hello there! I am working on making an Adventure/RPG visual novel that I am hoping to release on Steam one day. What I post here will most likely be code that did not make it to the final version, 
BUT it should still be workable code AND it will have all my notes/comments to see where my headspace was at or code I tried but commented out to not stop the program from running. Please let me know 
what you think!

script.rpy is just a label jump to the meat and potatoes of the program \n
events.rpy is a combat prototype, it is a bit ugly as most of it is not as organized as I would have hoped it to be, lessons learned
