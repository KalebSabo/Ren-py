Hello there! I am working on making an Adventure/RPG visual novel that I am hoping to release on Steam one day. What I post here will most likely be code that did not make it to the final version, 
BUT it should still be workable code AND it will have all my notes/comments to see where my headspace was at or code I tried but commented out to not stop the program from running. Please let me know 
what you think!

script.rpy is just a label jump to the meat and potatoes of the program <br/>
events.rpy is a combat prototype, I have already rewritten it to be better focused in particular areas of the program which will come out in a later post.
