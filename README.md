Hello there! I am working on making an Adventure/RPG visual novel that I am hoping to release on Steam one day. What I post here will most likely be code that did not make it to the final version, 
BUT it should still be workable code AND it will have all my notes/comments to see where my headspace was at or code I tried but commented out to not stop the program from running. Please let me know 
what you think!
